create global flags for new functionality.

in read_http_request(), look for /r, /b, /l and set flags

in construct_http_response() GET case, check for flags 
and redirect to new functions backup_helper(), recovery_helper(), list_helper()

backup_helper():
	get linux timestamp.
	create directory "./backup-[timestamp]"
	for every file in current directory:
		if it is not httpserver, httpserver.o, 
		httpserver.c, or a directory, and if
		it is 10 alphanumeric characters, copy 
		it into the backup using dog logic

recovery_helper():
	if there is no specified timestamp, 
		for all backups, find the most recent.
		set set filename to "/r/[timestamp]"
	get directory: "./backup-[timestamp]"
	if no such dir exists: error 404
	for each file inside, 
		copy to the host directory with dog logic

list_helper():
	for each file in directory:
		if it is a directory and contains sub-string "backup-":
			add filename to buffer
	give buffer back to client
